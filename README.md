 # 👋 Introduction to SimpleAPI Practice

Welcome to my Postman API testing practice! 🎉

This repository showcases my first **Postman API testing practice** where I’ve applied **real-world testing techniques** to a publicly available API (SimpleAPI) from [API Challenges](https://apichallenges.herokuapp.com/practice-modes/simpleapi). Through this project, I’ve learned how to write **API tests**, use **variables** to define dynamic values, and generate **automated reports** using **Newman**.

While I’m in the process of building up my Postman skills, this repository demonstrates my dedication to learning and my ability to apply **best practices** in API testing.

### What I’ve Learned:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand and see what I’ve learned</summary>
  
  - **Test Scripts**: I wrote test scripts in Postman to validate the correctness of API endpoints.
  - **Variables**: I used Postman’s collection variables to create dynamic tests that are flexible across different requests.
  - **Automated Reports**: I utilized **Newman** to automate running my Postman collections and generate detailed **HTML reports** for test execution results.

### Why This Project Matters:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand and see why this project matters</summary>

- **Practical Application**: Even as a beginner, this project helped me understand how **API testing** works in the context of a real API.
- **Learning Progress**: By referencing external resources like **API Challenges**, I’ve been able to explore API testing from scratch and work with **real-world data**.
- **Commitment to Growth**: I’m continually refining my skills in **Postman** and **API testing**, and this repository reflects my hands-on learning journey.

- **Postman Collections**: I’ve downloaded the Swagger file from [📚 Herokuapp SimpleAPI Practice](https://apichallenges.herokuapp.com/practice-modes/simpleapi) and used it to generate Postman collections that cover various API endpoints.
- **Test Cases**: Basic test scripts to check for response status, data validation, and error handling.
- **Automated Reports**: Reports generated by **Newman** in **HTML** format to show test results.
</details>


### How to Use This Repository:
